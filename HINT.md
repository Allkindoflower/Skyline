## About This Project

This project was initially built as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, where I followed a structured guide to learn and complete various coding challenges. While the foundation of the project was created based on FreeCodeCampâ€™s guidance, I have added personal touches, customized features, and improvements to make the project uniquely my own.

## My Concerns

I want to be transparent about the origin of this project. Although it was part of an educational exercise, I have included it in my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to code, implement best practices, and personalize projects. The work is my own, and the guided steps helped me solidify my skills in front-end development.


## Project Ownership

This project was built by me, and I claim ownership of all code written here. FreeCodeCamp provided the educational framework, but the code and any modifications are my own.
